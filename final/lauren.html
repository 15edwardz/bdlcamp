    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hi! My name is Lauren. I am 12 years old and I am going into middle school
      this school year. I live in Upper Beaches, Toronto and I am in the gifted
      program at Bowmore P.S.
    </p>

    <h3>Hobbies</h3>
    <li>
      Drawing. I used to take lessons, but now, I am learning digital drawing on
      my own.
    </li>
    <li>
      Reading. I read a lot in my spare time. I have even won a couple of
      read-a-thons at my old school. My favorite genres of books are probably
      historical fiction and realistic fiction.
    </li>
    <li>
      Playing tennis. I play tennis for fun since I think that is a great way to
      exercise. I am not very good yet, but I am improving by taking lessons and
      practicing.
    </li>
    <li>
      Learning languages. I do language learning lessons everyday. I can speak a
      little bit of Chinese and I am learning French on Duolingo. I started
      learning French at the end of the school year because the French lessons
      in grade 7 are going to be much more complicated. I have improved a lot
      and I can actually understand and speak a little bit of French. Currently,
      my streak on Duolingo is 51 days.
    </li>
    <li>
      Math contests. I enjoy doing math contests. I'm in Spirit of Math, which
      means that I also participate in a lot of math contests. I do them to
      exercise my brain and learn new things.
